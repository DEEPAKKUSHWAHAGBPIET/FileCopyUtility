File Copy Utility (Low-Level Syscalls)
üìå Overview

This project implements a simple file copy utility in C using only low-level system calls (open, read, write, lseek).
It also provides a byte-by-byte comparison tool to verify the accuracy of the copied file (to do this we can use inbuilt fun like : diff/fc).
The goal is to understand how file I/O works at the system call level, without using higher-level C library functions like fopen, fread, or fwrite.
‚öôÔ∏è Features
Copies a source file to a destination file using:
open() ‚Äì to open files
read() ‚Äì to read file contents
write() ‚Äì to write data into the destination
lseek() ‚Äì (optional) to manipulate file offsets if needed

Compares two files byte by byte to ensure correctness.
Cross-platform (Linux, macOS; with minor tweaks, also works on Windows using MinGW/WSL).

Compilation
gcc fileCopyUtility.c -o fileCopyUtility.exe
Run
fileCopyUtility.exe <src file> <destination file>

To check bytes difference:
fc src.txt des.txt
